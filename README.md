# Lyrics Project
Track favorite words of your favorite artist!

## This project contains following components:
1. A Hadoop Cluster. HDFS is used to store raw lyrics and artists data in JSON format.
2. Hbase. We use Hbase as a persistent database.
3. Hbase Thrift Server. We use thrift to serialize and diserialize the data flow into / out from Hbase.
4. Spark. We use Spark to process raw data and save the results into Hbase.
5. Yarn. We use Yarn as the resource manger and Spark job coordinator of the Hadoop Cluster.
6. Flask Backend Server. We build a backend server which talks to the Hbase database and answers queries from the front end.
7. Front End Page. We mainly use Bootstrap and JQuery in the front end.

## Dependency
Please install following software before you proceed.

    yum install python-devel
    yum install nodejs

    pip install happybase
    pip install pyspark
    pip install flask
    pip install raven
    pip install numpy

    npm install -g forever
    
## Build the Cluster
Please refer to the official documentation of Hadoop, Spark and Hbase regarding how to build a cluster. This project uses the latest version of them. Please install them in `/usr/local` directory.
To start the cluster, run following scripts:

    /usr/local/hadoop/sbin/start-all.sh
    /usr/local/hbase/bin/start-hbase.sh
    /usr/local/hbase/bin/hbase-daemon.sh start thrift -p 9090 --infoport 9095
    /usr/local/spark/sbin/start-all.sh
    
## Run Spark Jobs
Before running spark jobs, please download raw data from s3://w251lyrics-project/lyric.json.gz and s3://w251lyrics-project/full_US.json.gz. Save them to HDFS `/resources/raw_data` directory as `raw_lyrics.txt` and `raw_artists.txt` respectively.

    sh /usr/local/spark/bin/spark-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode cluster --num-executors 4 --executor-memory 3G --verbose --py-files /root/lyrics_project/common/constants.py /root/lyrics_project/scripts/pyspark/artists_job.py
    sh /usr/local/spark/bin/spark-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode cluster --num-executors 4 --executor-memory 3G --verbose --py-files /root/lyrics_project/common/constants.py /root/lyrics_project/scripts/pyspark/lyrics_job.py

## Start Web Server:
Please checkout this project from github and cd to the `lyrics_project/app` directory. Start the web server in background.

    forever start -c python server.py
